The **Campus Management System** is a C# application designed to efficiently manage student and teacher details within an educational institution. The system allows administrators to store, update, and retrieve information related to students and teachers, ensuring smooth campus operations.

The application is developed using **C#** for the frontend and connects to a **MySQL Workbench** database for secure and structured data management. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student and teacher records, making it easy to maintain academic and administrative details.
